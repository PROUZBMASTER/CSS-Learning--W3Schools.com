            What are Web Safe Fonts? 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
          Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.

        <h2>
            Fallback Fonts 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is always a chance that a font is not found or is not installed properly. 
            <br>
            Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts. 
            <br>
            This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in the <span style="background-color:#f1f1f1;color:red;">font-family</span> property. If the first font does not work, the browser will try the next one, and the next one, and so on. Always end the list with a generic font family name. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            Here, there are three font types:- Tahoma, Verdana, and sans-serif. The second and third fonts are backups, in case the first one is not found. 
            <br>
            <p style="font-family:tahoma, verdana, sans-serif;">
