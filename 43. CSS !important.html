            What is !important? 
        </h2>

        <p>
           The <span class="edit">!important</span> rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal. 
           <br>
           In fact, if you use the <span class="edit">!important</span> rule, it will override ALL previous styling rules for that specific property on that element! 
           <br>
           Let us look at an example:- 
           <br>
           <a href="43. CSS !important-Example 1.html" target="_blank">Example 1</a>

           <br>

           Example Explained:- 
           <br>
           In the example above, all three paragraphs will get a red background color, even though the ID selector and the class selector have a higher specificity. The <span class="edit">!important</span> rule overrides the <span class="edit">background-color</span> property in both cases.

            Important About !important 
        </h2>

        <p>
            The only way to override an <span class="edit">!important</span> rule is to include another <span class="edit">!important</span> rule on a declaration with the same (or higher) specificity in the source code - and here the problem starts! This makes the CSS code confusing and the debugging will be hard, especially if you have a large style sheet! 
            <br>
            Here we have created a simple example. It is not very clear, when you look at the CSS source code, which color is considered most important. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <a href="43. CSS !important-Example 2.html" target="_blank">Example 2</a>

            <br>

            <strong>Tip:- </strong>It is good to know about the <span class="edit">!important</span> rule. You might see it in some CSS source code. However, do not use it unless you absolutely have to.

        <h2>
            Maybe One or Two Fair Uses of !important 
        </h2>

        <p>
           One way to use <span class="edit">!important</span> is if you have to override a style that cannot be overridden in any other way. This could be if you are working on a Content Management System (CMS) and cannot edit the CSS code. Then you can set some custom styles to override some of the CMS styles. 
           <br>
           Another way to use <span class="edit">!important</span> is: Assume you want a special look for all buttons on a page. Here, buttons are styled with a gray background color, white text, and some padding and border. 
           <br>
           Example:- 
           <br>
           <a href="43. CSS !important-Example 3.html" target="_blank">Example 3</a>

           <br>
           <br>

           The look of a button can sometimes change if we put it inside another element with higher specificity, and the properties get in conflict. Here is an example of this:- 
           <br>
           Example:- 
           <br>
           <a href="43. CSS !important-Example 4.html" target="_blank">Example 4</a>

           <br>
           <br>

           To "force" all buttons to have the same look, no matter what, we can add the <span class="edit">!important</span> rule to the properties of the button, like this. 
           <br>
           Example:- 
           <br>
           <a href="43. CSS !important-Example 5.html" target="_blank">Example 5</a>

        </p>
