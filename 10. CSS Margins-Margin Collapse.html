            Sometimes two margins collapse into a single margin.

          Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is equal to the largest of the two margins. 
          <br>
          This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins! 
          <br>
          Look at the following example:-

          Example:-

          Demonstration of margin collapse:- 
          <br>
          <p>
            In this example the h1 element has a bottom margin of 50px and the h2 element has a top margin of 20px. So, the vertical margin between h1 and h2 should have been 70px (50px + 20px). However, due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px. 
          </p>
          <h1 style="margin:0 0 50px 0;">
            Heading 1
          </h1>
          <h2 style="margin:20px 0 0 0;">
            Heading 2
          </h2>

          <br>
          <br>

          In the example above, the &lt;h1&gt; element has a bottom margin of 50px and the &lt;h2&gt; element has a top margin set to 20px. 
          <br>
          Common sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the &lt;h1&gt; and the &lt;h2&gt; would be a total of 70px (50px + 20px). But due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px.
