        <p>
            CSS Comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code. 
        </p>

        <h2>
            CSS Comments 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date. 
            <br>
            Comments are ignored by browsers. 
            <br>
            A CSS comment is placed inside the &lt;style&gt; element, and starts with /* and ends with */:- 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <a href="6. CSS Comments-Single Line Comment.html" target="_blank">Single Line Comment</a>

            <br>
            <br>
            
            You can add comments wherever you want in the code:- 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <a href="6. CSS Comments-Single Line Comment.html" target="_blank">Single Line Comment</a>
            
            <br>
            <br>

            Comments can also span multiple lines:- 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <a href="6. CSS Comments-Single Line Comment.html" target="_blank">Multiple Line Comment</a>
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>
            HTML and CSS Comments 
        </h2>

        <br>

        <p>
            From the HTML tutorial, you learned that you can add comments to your HTML source by using the &lt;!--...--&gt; syntax. 
            <br>
            In the following example, we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments:- 
            <br>
            <a href="6. CSS Comments-HTML and CSS Comments.html" target="_blank">HTML and CSS Comments</a>
        </p>
